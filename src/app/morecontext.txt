E3 Kenya
Encourage, Engage, Empower
Building a Future Where Kenyan Women and Girls Lead the Way
Our Vision: A Kenya Where Every Woman and Girl Has the Opportunity to Make Her Own Decisions
At E3 we believe in a world where every Kenyan girl and woman is empowered to be an active participant in shaping her own life and community. We don’t just bring solutions; we work hand-in-hand with local women and girls to develop sustainable programs that reflect their needs and aspirations.
Our Mission: To Encourage, Engage, and Empower Kenyan Girls and Women through dialogue and community-inspired projects, increasing the number of those who become active participants in their own decision-making.  
Whether it’s through education, mentorship, or creating income-generating programs, we are committed to engaging with and empowering Kenyan girls and women as they seek greater freedoms and opportunities in their communities.

During the summer of 2024, we embarked on an inspiring initiative in partnership with MWEGO, a women’s empowerment group in Maasai Mara, to produce reusable, eco-friendly menstrual pads here in the United States and distribute the pads to adolescent girls in in six schools in the Mara.  Named by the local Maasai girls, the Osiligi Pad Project (Osiligi is the Maa word for hope) aims to provide girls with sanitary products and seeks to instruct girls and women how to make the pads, ultimately creating a self-sustaining program that meets a critical community need and also provides an opportunity for the girls and women to learn a valuable, income-producing skill.  
In October 2024, an E3 team traveled to the Mara with 2500 reusable menstrual pads and 5 small, portable sewing machines.  During a three-day training session, our Sisterherd Strong team engaged with 25 women and 10 adolescent girls as they traced and cut out pad patterns and practiced sewing skills. At the end of the training session the 2500 pads were distributed to 5 area representatives for distribution in the local schools. Plans are underway for a team to return in June 2025 for another, more in-depth training session.
And this is just the beginning.  A Sisterherd Strong board member has distributed 300 pads in western Kenya and we are working with colleagues to deliver over 500 pads in two locations in Nairobi.  Once follow-up evaluations from our initial distribution are completed, the Sisterherd Strong Pad Project will be expanded to encompass more adolescent girls.  At the same time, we encourage and welcome other projects that further our vision and our mission.
